Libraries:

osc-web can be used to send and receive osc with node.js

https://github.com/automata/osc-web

(so we can send notes from ableton etc. to webapp which could twitter or whatever)

---

Web Audio API can directly play sound data and actually directly synth sounds as well

Also, there is audiolib.js to make that easier https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/audiolib.js/#readme
(seems to have some problems in chrome, maybe needs newer version. firefox ok)

---

Lily is like puredata in firefox and can receive OSC

Midibridge is a java applet that allows midi access through javascript
It seems to implement a maybe-future brwoser midi api (proposed to w3c already)
